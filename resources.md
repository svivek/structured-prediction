There is no prescribed textbook for the class.

Readings for the course are either available on the course website or
will be provided as handouts in the class. Some additional resources are
listed below for background and extra reading:

1.   Noah Smith,
    [Linguistic structure prediction](http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00361ED1V01Y201105HLT013),
    2011. This book is available online if you are in the university
    network.

2.   Sebastian Nowozin and Christoph H. Lampert,
    [Structured Learning and Prediction in Computer Vision](http://www.nowozin.net/sebastian/papers/nowozin2011structured-tutorial.pdf), 2011.
    (Based on a tutorial at CVPR, 2011. The material can also be
    accessed
    [here](http://www.nowozin.net/sebastian/cvpr2011tutorial/)).

3.   Christopher D. Manning and Hinrich Schutze,
