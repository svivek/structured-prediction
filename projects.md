### Overview
<a name="overview">

The class project is an avenue for trying out ideas that you have seen
in the class in a practical setting. Projects should ideally be done
in groups of two.

*Projects should be done in groups of at most two students.*

----

### Expectations

- The project should be an application that is somewhat related to the
  class. That is, it should be an application where a structure is
  predicted. (Which means, no training a binary/multi-class classifier, even if
  the application is very interesting.)

- The project idea could come from you.  It could be about something that you
  are interested in or working on already.Of course, we are willing to
  brainstorm about the project with you and offer suggestions.

- Ideally, your project should explore some new directions (a new model, a new
  application, a new algorithm, a new insight into an old problem, etc.)

### Milestones and Grading
<a name="grading">

Your project is worth 50% of the class grade. This is broken down
across the following milestones:

1. **Form a project team** (5 points): Inform the instructor who is in the
   project group.

2. **Project proposal** (10 points): A document no longer than 2
   pages, consisting of the following information:

   - The problem. Describe the problem and mention why it is interesting along
     with a brief survey of related work. The survey doesn't need to be
     complete, but do include information about how your problem has been
     approached in the literature.  This will help you think about baselines to
     compare against in your experiments.

   - The data. Your proposal *should* describe the data that you have at
     hand. Ideally, you should have all the data that you need -- or have a plan
     that will get you the data within the next couple of weeks.

   - Your approach. Briefly describe your proposed approach. Why your method is
     different from what has been done and why is your new approach interesting.

   - Evaluation. How you will evaluate your system. If you are working on a
     standard data set, there is probably a standard evaluation that has been
     followed in the literature. You could describe this.


3. **Intermediate status report** (20 points): A two page document that says
   what you have done on the project so far.  By this time, you should have
   interacted with the instructor about your project. The report should
   describe:
   - The progress you have made towards your goal. (This can not be
     just "We collected data".) (50%)
   - Details of your plan for rest of the semester (30%)
   - Pointers to literature (20%)

3. **Project report** (35 points): A document no longer than 8 pages, structured
   like a research paper.
   1. What problem did you work on? Why is it interesting?
   2. What are the important ideas you explored?
   3. What ideas from the class did you use?
   4. What did you learn?
   5. Results (or for theoretical project, proofs)
   6. If you had much more time, how would you continue the project?
   7. If your project had two members, your report should explain what each of
      you did.

   Each of these components will be equally weighted in the report
   grade.

3. **Presentation** (30 points): Instead of the final exam, we will have a
   presentation of the projects in the class. *More details as we go along.*
