title: Paper Reviews
---

Most assignments for this class will take the form of paper reviews. Typically,
you will be given a list of papers (taken from the [lecture
pages](lectures.html)), from which you can choose one paper to review.  You can
submit your review any time before the deadline via Canvas.

I am hoping that the reviews will be like peer reviews for conference or journal
papers. We will use a Canvas form for this purpose.

For each paper, you should first start off with a one paragraph description of
the core contribution of the paper *in your own words*, followed by a list of
pros and cons of the approach. After this, you should be creative and discuss
how you would extend or develop this paper, if you had been the author. End the
review with questions, doubts, or any thoughts about the paper. You could also
list experiments or results that you think would strengthen the paper.

#### Some tips

- **Do not** comment about the grammar and typos. We are reading the
  paper as computer scientists and are interested in the
  underlying ideas. Please be constructive and remember that a
  critical review is meant to critique, not merely criticize.

- Summarize the paper in your own words in a couple of sentences. This
  will help you understand the paper better.

- Identify the main scientific contribution of the paper

  -   A good paper will try to answer a specific question. Try to
      identify this question. For example, this could be a new idea, a
      unification of previous ideas into a more general framework, or
      an implementation of an idea to show that it works.

  -   Sometimes the question asked by the paper might be its most
      important contribution

  -   Sometimes the novelty of the approach could be its biggest
      selling factor

- Identify the problem being solved by the paper

  -   Every paper tries to solve a problem. What is it for this one?

  -   Was the problem worth solving? Are there simpler solutions that
      the authors did not consider and might have worked just as well?
      Does the solution have limitations?

- Identify the positive aspects of the paper

  -   What are the good ideas? What is their *potential* influence?

  -   How could you generalize the ideas?

  -   If you start research in this direction, what will be *your*
      next step?

- Identify the assumptions and claims made by the paper

  -   Are they reasonable? Will they ever hold?

  -   Given the assumptions, what does the paper claim?

  -   Given the assumptions, are the claims of the paper reasonably
      justified? What is the flow of reasoning?

- If the paper has experiments, identify the value of the experimental
  evaluation

  -   Does the paper use the right set of experiments?

  -   Is the experimental setup convincing? What other
      experiments/results would strengthen the paper?

  -   Do the experiments really persuade you about the paper's claims?
      Do the results persuade you?

- Always try to think about how this paper would be situated among
  other relevant papers.

  -   Are the ideas novel, or have they appeared before?
