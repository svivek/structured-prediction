By the time someone realizes they damaged a ligament, tendon or
cartilage from too much exercise or other types of physical activity,
itâ€™s too late. The tissue is stretched and torn and the person is
writhing in pain.

But a team of researchers led by University of Utah bioengineering
professors Jeffrey Weiss and Michael Yu has discovered that damage to
collagen, the main building block of all human tissue, can occur much
earlier at a molecular level from too much physical stress, alerting
doctors and scientists that a patient is on the path to major tissue
damage and pain.
