In statistics and in statistical physics, the Metropolis–Hastings
algorithm is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for obtaining a
sequence of random samples from a probability distribution for which
direct sampling is difficult. This sequence can be used to approximate
the distribution (e.g., to generate a histogram), or to compute an
integral (such as an expected value). Metropolis–Hastings and other
MCMC algorithms are generally used for sampling from multi-dimensional
distributions, especially when the number of dimensions is high. For
single-dimensional distributions, other methods are usually available
(e.g. adaptive rejection sampling) that can directly return
independent samples from the distribution, and are free from the
problem of autocorrelated samples that is inherent in MCMC methods.
