This course gives a graduate level overview of concepts and techniques
for statistical modeling of structured data.  Much of the data we see
is in an unstructured form â€“ text, images, videos, etc. How do we
efficiently learn to extract structured information from such raw
data? This could involve tasks such as parsing a sentence, creating a
tabulated summary of the information in a webpage, adding tags to an
image, recognizing objects in images, etc. The common thread across
these applications is that predicting the output requires assignments
to multiple interdependent variables.  In this course, we will study
topics in structured learning and prediction, with a focus on ideas
that have emerged in the last couple of decades. We will look at
several techniques for structured output learning and prediction using
examples from natural language processing, computer vision and related
areas.  See course information for details about course mechanics and
policies.
