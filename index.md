This course gives a graduate level overview of concepts and techniques
for statistical modeling of structured data.

Much of the data we see is in an unstructured form---text, images, videos,
etc. How do we efficiently learn to extract structured information from such raw
data? This could involve tasks such as parsing a sentence, creating a tabulated
summary of the information in a webpage, adding tags to an image, recognizing
objects in images, etc. The common thread across these applications is that
predicting the output requires assignments to multiple interdependent variables.

In this course, we will study topics in structured learning and prediction, with
a focus on ideas that have emerged in the last couple of decades. We will look
at several techniques for structured output learning and prediction using
examples from natural language processing, computer vision and related areas.

## Course objectives, or: What can I expect to learn?

By the end of the course, you should be able to critically read current
literature and use the ideas learned to:

1. Define structured models for new problems,

2. Identify or develop learning paradigms given constraints on
  available data and time for training, and

3. Identify or develop inference algorithms for predicting outputs
  given computational constraints.
