### Prerequisites
<a name="prerequisites">

Students are expected to be familiar with the basics of machine learning to the
extent covered in the machine learning course in the School of Computing.

Of course, we will introduce some of the relevant prerequisite concepts in the
lectures as needed, but knowing the topics will significantly help in
understanding the new material.

### Course Expectations & Assignments
<a name="expectations">

This is an advanced course that is primarily aimed towards helping you
understand recent research to the extent of implementing and using techniques
that you may read in papers and, also, hopefully guide you towards becoming a
researcher.

Enrolled students are expected to:

* Attend class lectures, participate in the class,

* Complete readings and submit critical reviews in a timely fashion,
  
  Required and additional recommended readings will be assigned for each
  lecture. The lectures will be based around the readings.  You will write short
  (less than two page) critical reviews of three of the papers in the additional
  readings. You can select any papers from the ones on the website and submit
  the reviews before the deadlines listed

* Complete other assignments in a timely fashion, and,
   
* Complete a project (in a group at most two students) and submit a report.

There will be no exams.

### Grading

Your grade is based on the following

- Paper reviews and assignments (30%),
- Project report and presentation (50%), and
- Class participation (5%)

### Course Policies
<a name="course-policies">

#### School of Computing Policies and Guidelines
   
The class operates under the School of Computing's [policies and
guidelines](http://www.cs.utah.edu/socguidelines/). Among other things, the
linked page provides information about the [academic misconduct
policy](http://www.cs.utah.edu/academic-misconduct/) that we will adhere to.

Also see the [College of Engineering
guidelines](https://www.coe.utah.edu/students/academic-affairs/academics/semester-guidelines/)
for information about appeals procedures, withdrawal procedures, and adding and
repeating courses.

#### Collaboration and Cheating

Collaboration is encouraged; cheating will not be tolerated.


<center><u>Honor code for this class</u></center>

> You are encouraged to discuss class materials with your peers. If
> you want you can form study groups because discussions help
> understanding. You are also welcome to discuss
> assignments. 
> 
> However, you must write your own solutions, proofs and code and
> submit your own solution. Do not copy or ask for assignments from
> other students or the internet. Do not let someone else copy your
> submissions either.

If you are caught cheating once, you *will* receive a failing grade
for that submission. If you are caught cheating again, you will fail
the class.
 
For projects, you are free to discuss the project with anyone in
your project group.
 
For both assignments and projects, you should cite all sources that
you refer to. This includes personal communication, books, papers,
websites, etc. Doing so reflects academic integrity.
