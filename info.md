### Course Expectations & Assignments
<a name="expectations">

This is an advanced course that is primarily aimed towards helping you
understand recent research to the extent of implementing and using techniques
that you may read in papers and, also, hopefully guide you towards becoming a
researcher.

Enrolled students are expected to:

* Attend class lectures, participate in the class,
* Complete readings and submit critical reviews in a timely fashion,<br/>
  Required and additional recommended readings will be assigned for each
  lecture. The lectures will be based around the readings.  You will write short
  reviews of three of the papers taken from the additional readings.
* Complete other assignments in a timely fashion, and,
* Complete a semester-long project (in a group at most two students) and submit
  a report.

There will be no exams.
