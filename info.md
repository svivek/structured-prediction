### Prerequisites
<a name="prerequisites">

Students are expected to be familiar with the basics of machine
learning to the extent covered in the machine learning course in the
School of Computing.

Of course, we will introduce some of the relevant prerequisite
concepts in the lectures as needed, but knowing the topics will
significantly help in understanding the new material.

----

### Course Expectations & Assignments
<a name="expectations">

This is an advanced course that is primarily aimed towards helping you
understand recent research to the extent of implementing and using
techniques that you may read in papers and, also, hopefully guide you
towards becoming a researcher.

Enrolled students are expected to:

* Attend class lectures, participate in the class,

* Complete readings and submit critical reviews in a timely fashion,

> Required and additional recommended readings will be assigned for
> each lecture. The lectures will be based around the readings. 
> 
> You will write short (less than two page) critical reviews of three
> of the papers in the additional readings. You can select any papers
> from the ones on the website and submit the reviews before the
> deadlines listed

* Present at least one paper from the additional readings in the
   class and lead discussion around it, and,
   
* Complete a project (in a group at most two students) and submit a
  report.

There will be no exams.

#### Grading

Your grade is based on the following

- [Paper reviews](reviews-presentations.html#reviews) (30%),
- [Class presentation](reviews-presentations.html#presentations) (15%),
- [Project report and presentation](projects.html) (50%), and
- Class participation (5%)

Your paper reviews must be submitted electronically on Canvas by
*midnight* of the due date.  *Hand written assignments or printouts
will not be accepted.*

#### Late policy

All assignments must be submitted by the deadline. We will use the
timestamp on Canvas as the submission time. Assignments will be
accepted up to 24 hours after deadline, but will be assessed a 10%
penalty. That is, if your assignment is late and scores 90, then your
actual grade will be 81 = 90 - 9. Assignments will *not* be accepted
24 hours after the deadline.

We will be strict about this policy: If the deadline is midnight and
you submit the assignment at 12:01 AM, you will face the 10% penalty!

If there are extraordinary non-academic circumstances, let me know
before the deadlines.
   

#### No double dipping projects across multiple classes

You can not submit the same project to this class and another class
that you may be taking at the same time. If you are doing related
projects in two different classes, there may be some overlap (e.g. in
code libraries, etc.), but they should not be identical. A project
that is found to be double-submitted will receive *zero* credit. If
you have questions about this policy, please contact the instructor.

### Course Policies
<a name="course-policies">

* **Collaboration and cheating**: Collaboration is encouraged;
  cheating will not be tolerated.
   
  *Important*: The class operates under the School of Computing's
  [policy on academic misconduct](http://www.cs.utah.edu/docs/misc/cheating_policy.pdf).
  Students should read it and, if you haven't done so already, sign the
  [acknowledgment form](https://www.cs.utah.edu/docs/misc/SoC_ack_form.pdff)
  within two weeks of the start of the semester.
      
  **<u>Honor code for this class</u>**
   
  You are encouraged to discuss class materials with your peers. If
  you want you could form study groups because discussions help
  understanding. You are also welcome to discuss assignments. However,
  you must write your own solutions, proofs or code and submit your
  own solution. Do not copy or ask for assignments from other students
  or the internet. Do not let someone else copy your submissions
  either.
  
  If you are caught cheating once, you *will* receive a failing grade
  for that submission. If you are caught cheating again, you will fail
  the class.
   
  For projects, you are free to discuss the project with anyone in your
  project group.
   
  For both assignments and projects, you should cite all sources that
  you refer to. This includes personal communication, books, papers,
  websites, etc. Doing so reflects academic integrity.
   
* **Students with disabilities**: The University of Utah seeks to
provide equal access to its programs, services and activities for
people with disabilities. Please let me know as soon as possible. If
you wish to qualify for exemptions under the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA), you should also notify the
[Center for Disability Services](http://disability.utah.edu/).

* Also see the
[College of Engineering guidelines](http://www.coe.utah.edu/wp-content/uploads/pdf/faculty/semester_guidelines.pdf)
for information about appeals, the Americans with Disabilities Act,
repeating courses and add and withdraw deadlines.

### Communication with Teaching Staff
<a name="communication">

We strongly encourage you to post your questions on the
[class discussion board on Canvas]({{site.canvas}}/discussion_topics),
unless you have a question that you wish to keep confidential. The
instructor and the TA will monitor the forum and will answer
questions. Other students may also be able to answer questions on
Canvas.

For grading questions, project related issues or simply a more
hands-on interaction, we encourage you to attend the office hours or
meet the instructor/TA after class.

Of course, for personal/private questions, do feel free contact the
instructor or the TA by email or in person.
