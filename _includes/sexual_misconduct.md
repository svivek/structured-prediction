Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender
(which includes sexual orientation and gender identity/expression) is a civil
rights offense subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of
support applied to offenses against other protected categories such as race,
national origin, color, religion, age, status as a person with a disability,
veteranâ€™s status or genetic information.

If you, or someone you know, are harassed or assaulted, you are encouraged to
report it to the Title IX Coordinator in the Office of Equal Opportunity and
Affirmative Action, 135 Park Building, 801-581-8365, or the Office of the Dean
of Students, 270 Union Building, 801-581-7066. For support and confidential
consultation, contact the Center for Student Wellness, 426 SSB, 801-581-7776. To
report to the police, contact the Department of Public Safety,
801-585-2677(COPS).
