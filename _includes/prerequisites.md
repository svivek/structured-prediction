This course does not have formal pre-requisites, but students are expected to be
familiar with the basics of machine learning to the extent covered in the
machine learning course in the School of Computing.

Of course, we will introduce some of the relevant prerequisite concepts in the
lectures as needed, but knowing the topics will significantly help in
understanding the new material.
