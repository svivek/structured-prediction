If you are caught cheating once, you *will* receive a failing grade for that
submission. If you are caught cheating again, you will fail the class.
 
For projects, you are free to discuss the project with your classmates, but your
work should be your own.
 
For both assignments and the project, you should cite all sources that you refer
to. This includes personal communication, books, papers, websites, etc. Doing so
reflects academic integrity.
