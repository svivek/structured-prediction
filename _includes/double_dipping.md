You can not submit the same project to this class and another class that you may
be taking at the same time. If you are doing related projects in two different
classes, there may be some overlap (e.g. in code libraries, etc.), but they
should not be identical. A project that is found to be double-submitted will
receive *zero* credit. If you have questions about this policy, please contact
the instructor.
