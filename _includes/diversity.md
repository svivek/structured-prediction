It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be
well-served by this course, that studentsâ€™ learning needs be addressed both in
and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class
be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is our intent to present
materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity,
sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality,
religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please
let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally,
or for other students or student groups.
