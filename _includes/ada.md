The University of Utah seeks to provide equal access to its programs, services
and activities for people with disabilities. If you will need accommodations in
the class, reasonable prior notice needs to be given to the [Center for
Disability and Access](http://disability.utah.edu). CDA will work with you and
the instructor to make arrangements for accommodations. Accommodations cannot be
given without paperwork from this office.
