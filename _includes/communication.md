We strongly encourage you to post your questions on the [class discussion board
on Canvas]({{site.canvas}}/discussion_topics), unless you have a question that
you wish to keep confidential. The instructor and the TAs will monitor the forum
and will answer questions. Other students may also be able to answer questions
on Canvas.

For grading questions, project related issues or simply a more hands-on
interaction, do attend the office hours or meet the instructor after class.

Of course, for personal/private questions, do feel free contact the instructor
by email or in person.

Please note that discussion threads and emails are all considered to be
equivalent to the classroom, and your behavior in all these venues should
conform to the university's student code.
