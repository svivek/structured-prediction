All assignments must be submitted by the deadline. We will use the
timestamp on Canvas as the submission time. Assignments will be
accepted up to 24 hours after deadline, but will be assessed a 10%
penalty. That is, if your assignment is late and scores 90, then your
actual grade will be 81 = 90 - 9. 

Assignments will *not* be accepted 24 hours after the deadline.

We will be strict about this policy: If the deadline is midnight and
you submit the assignment at 12:01 AM, you will face the 10% penalty!
