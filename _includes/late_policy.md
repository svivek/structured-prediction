All submissions should be made by the deadline. We will use the timestamp on
Canvas as the submission time. Submissions will be accepted up to 24 hours after
deadline, but will be assessed a 10% penalty. That is, if your submission is
late and scores 90, then your actual grade will be 81 = 90 - 9.

Submissions will *not* be accepted 24 hours after the deadline.

We will be strict about this policy: If the deadline is midnight and you submit
the assignment at 12:01 AM, you will face the 10% penalty!
